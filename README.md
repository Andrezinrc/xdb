# xdb

x86 (32-bit) instruction interpreter with an interactive debugger.

This project focuses on **understanding, observing, and controlling** low-level x86 execution, prioritizing clarity and control over performance or full architectural coverage.

## Scope

- x86 32-bit instruction interpretation and execution
- Interactive step-by-step debugger
- Register and memory inspection and modification
- Breakpoints and execution flow analysis

## Usage

```bash
./xdb <program.bin>
```

## Purpose

xdb is intended as a study and experimentation tool, allowing analysis of how x86 instructions are decoded, executed, and how they affect CPU and memory state
